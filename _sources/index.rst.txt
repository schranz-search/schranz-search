Welcome to SEAL's documentation!
================================

Introduction
------------

**SEAL** stands for: **S** earch **E** ngine **A** bstraction **L** ayer

The SEAL project is a PHP library designed to simplify the process of interacting
with different search engines. It provides a straightforward interface that enables users
to communicate with various search engines, including:

- ``Meilisearch``
- ``Opensearch``
- ``Elasticsearch``
- ``Algolia``
- ``Loupe``
- ``Redisearch``
- ``Solr``
- ``Typesense``

It also provides integration packages for the ``Laravel``, ``Symfony``, ``Spiral``, ``Mezzio`` and ``Yii`` PHP frameworks.

It is worth noting that the project draws inspiration from the
``Doctrine`` and ``Flysystem`` projects. These two projects have been a great inspiration
in the development of SEAL, as they provide excellent examples of how to create consistent
and user-friendly APIs for complex systems.

Structure
---------

  :alt: Basic project overview

SEAL's provides a basic abstraction layer for add, remove and search and filters for documents.
The main class and service handling this is called ``Engine``, which is responsible for all this things.
The ``Schema`` which is required defines the different ``Indexes`` and their ``Fields``.

The project provides different ``Adapters`` which the Engine uses to communicate with the different ``Search Engine`` software and services.
This way it is easy to switch between different search engine software and services.
